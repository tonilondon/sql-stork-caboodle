# Writing Your First SQL Query

## Basic SQL Syntax
A SQL query requires at least two clauses:
1. **SELECT**: Specifies the columns to retrieve.
2. **FROM**: Specifies the table to query.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT City
FROM PatientDim;

SQL Clauses Execution Order

This order affects how queries are processed by the database.
